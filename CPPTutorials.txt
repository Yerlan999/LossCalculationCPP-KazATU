Ctrl + F7 = Compile current source (.cpp) file
F5 = Build a solution (project). Compiling and Linking happens

#include <library.h>  -  preprocessor statements (happens before the compilation) 
 namely:
	#include, #define, #if, #endif #ifdef. (#define INTEGER int) = replaces INTEGER with int 
						while compiling

int main(){}  -  main function is called entry point of the application.
		You do not have to return any kind of value from the main function.
		It is a special case. It returns 0 (zero) under the hood

When building a project... Each .cpp files (translation units) gets compiled into .obj files 
		(or object files) and then Linker comes into a play here and 
		converts them into a .exe
		executable file 

C++ is a files agnostic, meaning c++ does not care about files at all.
